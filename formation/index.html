                <h1 id="project-solicitation">Project Solicitation</h1>
<p>Collaborative team building begins with the writing of the funding solicitation. A solicitation is a short document advertising an opportunity for researchers to apply for funding to work on a specific project. Traditionally, researchers gather together a small handful of trusted colleagues and write a proposal aimed at convincing the funding agency that their group is best equipped, and has the best ideas, to solve the problem at hand, and should therefore be funded. By funding several such teams in any particular round of funding, the idea is that at least one or two teams will generate enough new ideas to move the field forward. This funding model has generated a lot of high impact science over the years.</p>
<p>But what if a resarch problem is too broad or complex for a single team to address? Many program managers have recognized the need for building connections across the handful of teams that get funded in a project. This is usually motivated by a desire to reduce duplication of effort and to advance the science in ways that cannot be done in isolation. </p>
<p>A well crafted solicitation (click <a href="https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/viewrepositorydocument/cmdocumentid=667142/solicitationId=%7B7135C126-14E7-AB73-B612-4E67C4B0FA30%7D/viewSolicitationDocument=1/A.40%20High%20Mountain%20Asia%20POC%20change.pdf">here</a> for a good example) can set the stage for this collaboration to occur. The following elements are critical:</p>
<h2 id="motivate-the-collaboration">Motivate the collaboration</h2>
<p>Scientists are trained to work for long hours in isolation to accomplish highly complex tasks. They usually share this work with a small set of trusted colleagues, based on relationships formed over many years. Asking them to rapidly connect with a large group of new researchers takes effort that should be clearly justified. </p>
<p>A well crafted solicitation will provide a vision for what could be achieved through the extra effort invested in collaboration. Specific examples should be provided, for example the linking of modeling studies with field observations that will lead to improved validation and calibration. In our view, researchers should be encouraged to bring their specialty to the table (in this example, either modeling or field expertise) while describing how they would interface with teams having different expertise. One challenge we have identified in past collaborative efforts is that every team, perhaps in an effort to increase their chances to be funded, proposed to do every part of the collaboration pipeline, leaving us with multiple teams "trying to do it all". We would rather see each team bringing a unique set of skills to the table that can then be integrated with other teams to produce something that could not have been achieved in isolation.</p>
<h2 id="provide-clear-expectations">Provide clear expectations</h2>
<p>Research scientists who spend time writing proposals get very good at estimating how much time they should request in their budgets to cover the work that needs to get done. But when cross-team collaboration is added to the mix, it gets harder to know how much extra time this will take. Researchers may wonder, should I roll the collaboration in to the amount of time I would have asked for in a less-collaborative proposal? Should I double my request? Am I expected to do the collaboration on the side? A good solicitation will offer some parameters to aid in this decision process. Providing specific guidelines, for example that some percent of effort should be dedicated to collaboration, and to plan budgets accordingly, is ideal. </p>
<h2 id="provide-reporting-and-reward-structures">Provide reporting and reward structures</h2>
<p>Building and maintaining collaborations takes time that might otherwise be dedicated to writing papers and advancing one's own individual science objectives. Teams that engage most in a collaborative process may find themselves with fewer academic products to show for that fulfill traditional metrics, primarily numbers of papers published. A solicitation that truly wishes to build collaboration should describe other metrics for rewarding collaborations. This might include numbers of datasets shared, participation in leading sub-group activities, numbers of contributions to open-source software repositories, or other tasks. There should also be clear guidelines on how to report on these less traditional academic performance metrics.</p>
<h1 id="team-selection-and-composition">Team Selection and Composition</h1>
<p>Every agency has its own merit-based system for evaluating proposals that include metrics such as intrinsic scientific merit, relevance to the solicitation and appropriateness of the budget. These systems are designed to evaluate the potential success or failure of individual projects, but to our knowledge there are no formal metrics in place for evaluating a team's collaborative potential and likelihood for building connections across projects. One way this might be improved is by asking proposers to demonstrate how they have approached collaboration in past efforts. Specific examples could include contributions to multi-institution research articles or community open-source software packages.</p>
<p>Once the panel review is complete the successfully-funded projects are notified. A typical solicitation funds 10 to 15 different teams, each of which is led by one lead Principal Investigator (PI) based out of a host institution who manages that particular award. Each of these PI groups often includes several co-investigators, graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and technicians. Therefore the total size of the team involved in the collaboration can be anywhere from 50 to 100 people. </p>
<h1 id="administrative-roles">Administrative Roles</h1>
<p>Managing and facilitating highly collaborative scientific research requires investment in a variety of administrative roles. </p>
<h2 id="program-manager">Program Manager</h2>
<p>The role of the program manager is to write the solicitation, guide the proposal peer-review process, allocate funds and provide big-picture guidance to the teams. For a high collaborative effort we recommend close coordination between the program manager and other administrative support described below, especially the science team lead. This will help ensure clear communication of high level programmatic needs to the group. </p>
<h2 id="project-manager">Project Manager</h2>
<p>There should be a dedicated Project Manager who takes care of logistics, schedules meetings, keeps records of team membership, tracks publications, organizes in-person meetings and facilitates communication between all the various players. The best project managers will have some working understanding of the broad research objectives of the teams so that they can be on the lookout for potential collaborative opportunities as they arise.</p>
<h2 id="science-team-lead">Science Team Lead</h2>
<p>In some programs, agencies offer additional funding to a PI who applies to be science team lead (the application is made through some additional pages allowed within the proposal write-up). In our experience, the position of Science Team Lead is a relatively new role, one that is important in guiding the collaborative aspects of the project, but also one for which there is no explicit roadmap. Recongnizing that there are few opportunities for research scientists to receive training in project leadership and administration, here we offer here a roadmap of what we believe to be the most important considerations when desinging the role of science team lead:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>within complex, multidimensional research projects, it is unreasonable for any one person to have all the answers. Top-down, hierarchical leadership approaches are not well suited to these kinds of dynamic research environments. We instead advocate for adaptive leadership approaches that enables complex networks of scientists to respond with innovation and creativity as new challenges arise (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1048984307000689">Uhl-Bien et al., 2007</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the science team lead is expected to coordinate research activities within their own proposal group, as well as guide the collaboration of the larger team. We suggest it is difficult for one person to adequately attend to both of these leadership roles. If teams are serious about building collaborations, it may be necessary to give the team lead sufficient latitude to focus attention outside of their own individual research priorities for a few years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when a leadership role is assigned to an individual, others in the community may look to this person as having some new level of authority bestowed upon them. For example, the science team lead may be approached by researchers on other teams with questions about funding, or the approval of specific activities within teams. This may create unnecessary boundaries and social tensions between the team lead and the researchers. We recommend offering early in the project a high-level explanation to all team members clearly describing the roles and responsibilities of the team lead so as to avoid these miscommunications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>modern examples of the role of team lead includes that of "science integrator" (<a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/10.1175/BAMS-D-14-00289.1">Brugger et al., 2016</a>), a person who condenses large amounts of information and distills this to decision makers and stakeholders. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="team-facilitator">Team Facilitator</h2>
<p>Successful collaboration hinges on effective communication. With everyone facing greater demands on their time, meetings between scientists need to be designed to maximize opportunities for connection and exchange of ideas. We believe that partnering with professional facilitators helps achieve these goals. A good facilitator will offer methods for structuring remote and in-person interactions in ways that challenge participants to bring their best ideas to the table, while providing a framework for managing challenging discussions about authorship and data sharing.</p>
<h2 id="project-data-coordinator">Project Data Coordinator</h2>
<p>As datasets become increasingly large and complex it has become more difficult for teams to share data across groups. Challenges include a lack of community standards with respect to data formatting and units, institutional firewalls that limit or block the transfer of large datasets, and a wide variety of available programming languages and tools. While many agencies do provide repositories for hosting data for distribution after a publication, collaborative teams also require infrastructure for sharing preliminary results and working products prior to publication. A Project Data Coordinator should be available to facilitate data sharing on secure, flexible platforms that enable file sharing across institutions. This person should also assist in creating consistent metadata, manage data sharing agreements, develop educational material for navigating technical challenges, and be an interface between researchers and the data archival centers.</p>
<h2 id="principal-investigators">Principal Investigators</h2>
<p>Principal Investigators are responsible for leading their own teams. Within the scope of a collaborative effort, they also have a responsibility to represent their team's work in coordination discussions with the Science Team Lead. Principal Investigators should also play a role in facilitating communication between their team and the broader group. </p>
<h1 id="getting-connected">Getting Connected</h1>
<p>Once the overall teams are selected and each of the roles described above are in place, it is time for people to start getting connected. This is a crucial phase of the project: the relationships formed at the inception of the project will be the foundation upon which the entire team builds trust. Without establishing this trust early on, it will be difficult to convince people to share their data and take risks in discussing new ideas.</p>
<h2 id="personnel-chart">Personnel Chart</h2>
<p>This simplest way to get connected is to provide everyone with a roadmap of who is on the team. The Project Manager should compile a spreadsheet that contains information on each team member's name, contact information, institution and position. It is important to include everyone who may be involved in the project, from research technicians to faculty to program managers. It is helpful to then turn this information into a chart or graphic that maps out each of the team, for example by PI group. This information should be shared freely across the team.</p>
<p><img alt="teamMap" src="../images/teamMap.jpg" /></p>
<h2 id="team-competencies">Team Competencies</h2>
<p>Now that we have a map of the team composition, it helps to know what unique skills each person is bringing to the project. One approach we have used is to send out a brief survey to each team member and ask them to provide their top three skills in various categories including research domain knowledge and technical skills (e.g. computer languages and computational platforms).</p>
<h2 id="discovering-complementary-and-overlapping-work">Discovering Complementary and Overlapping Work</h2>
<p>One of the greatest potential barriers to cross-team collaboration is that multiple teams may have proposed to do similar tasks. This sets up a tension within the group as each researcher tries to be the first to publish and gain credit for a specific activitity. Therefore it is fundamentally important that structures be put in place that facilitate both a discovery of overlapping work, as well an opportunity for teams to adjust their workplans so that their work can be collaborative and complementary</p>
